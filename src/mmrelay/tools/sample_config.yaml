meshtastic:
  connection_type: tcp # Choose either "tcp", "serial", or "ble"
  host: meshtastic.local # Only used when connection is "tcp"
  serial_port: /dev/ttyUSB0 # Only used when connection is "serial"
  ble_address: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF # Only used when connection is "ble" - Uses either an address or name from a `meshtastic --ble-scan`
  meshnet_name: Your Meshnet Name # This is displayed in full on Matrix, but is truncated when sent to a Meshnet
  message_interactions: # Configure reactions and replies (both require message storage in database)
    reactions: false # Enable reaction relaying between platforms
