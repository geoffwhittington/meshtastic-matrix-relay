# MMRelay v1.0 Released ðŸ”–

We're pleased to announce MMRelay v1.0, our first stable major release since the project's inception in April 2023. This version marks a significant milestone, reflecting steady improvements driven by our contributors and users.

## Special Thanks

We sincerely thank everyone who contributed code, provided feedback, or helped test MMRelay. Your efforts have directly shaped this release.

## What's New in v1.0

- **PyPI Release**: Quickly install via `pipx install mmrelay`
- **Standardized Configuration**: Uses `platformdirs` for consistent configuration paths
- **Enhanced CLI**: Improved command-line experience and new options
- **Absolute Imports**: Clearer, more maintainable codebase
- **Configuration Improvements**:
  - Standard locations for config files, logs, and plugins
  - Backward compatible with existing setups
  - Clear migration path for legacy configurations

### Important Changes

Some configuration options have been renamed for clarity:

- `db:` â†’ `database:` (old option still works but will show a deprecation notice)
- `network` connection mode â†’ `tcp` (both options supported for compatibility)

## Need More Time?

**Not ready to upgrade yet?** No problem!

If you've pulled the latest changes but need more time to prepare for the upgrade, you can continue using the previous release:
