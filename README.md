## (Meshtastic <=> Matrix Relay)

A powerful and easy-to-use relay between Meshtastic devices and Matrix chat rooms, allowing seamless communication across platforms. This opens the door for bridging Meshtastic devices to [many other platforms](https://matrix.org/bridges/).

---

## Getting Started

MMRelay runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Quick Installation

```bash
# Recommended: Install with pipx for isolated environments
pipx install mmrelay

# For End-to-End Encryption support (Linux/macOS only)
pipx install 'mmrelay[e2e]'
```

> **Note**: You can also use `pip install mmrelay` if you prefer, but pipx provides better isolation.
> New to pipx? [Learn how to install it here](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/#installing-pipx).

### Resources

- **New Users**: See [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for setup and configuration
- **Existing Users**: See [UPGRADE_TO_V1.md](UPGRADE_TO_V1.md) for migration guidance

## Features

- Bidirectional message relay between Meshtastic devices and Matrix chat rooms, capable of supporting multiple meshnets
- Supports serial, network, and **_BLE (now too!)_** connections for Meshtastic devices
- Custom fields are embedded in Matrix messages for relaying messages between multiple meshnets
- Truncates long messages to fit within Meshtastic's payload size
- SQLite database to store node information for improved functionality
- Customizable logging level for easy debugging
- Configurable through a simple YAML file
- Supports mapping multiple rooms and channels 1:1
- Relays messages to/from an MQTT broker, if configured in the Meshtastic firmware
- ✨️ _Cross-platform reactions support_ ✨️ **NEW!!**

### End-to-End Encryption Support

MMRelay now supports Matrix End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) on Linux and macOS platforms! To use this feature:

1. Install with E2EE support: `pipx install 'mmrelay[e2e]'`
2. Enable E2EE in your config.yaml:

```yaml
matrix:
  # ... other matrix settings ...
  e2ee:
    enabled: true
    # Optional: specify a custom store path
    # store_path: ~/.mmrelay/store
    # Optional: specify a device ID
    # device_id: ABCDEFGHIJ
```

E2EE support allows MMRelay to participate in encrypted Matrix rooms while maintaining all custom message fields required for proper relay functionality.

#### Install a Community Plugin

Add the repository under the `community-plugins` section in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
community-plugins:
  example-plugin:
    active: true
    repository: https://github.com/jeremiah-k/mmr-plugin-template.git
    tag: main
```

### Plugin System

MMRelay features a powerful plugin system with standardized locations:

- **Core Plugins**: Pre-installed with the package
