# Meshtastic <=> Matrix Relay

A powerful and easy-to-use relay between Meshtastic devices and Matrix chat rooms, allowing seamless communication across platforms. This opens the door for bridging Meshtastic devices to [many other platforms](https://matrix.org/bridges/).

## Features

- Bidirectional message relay between Meshtastic devices and Matrix chat rooms, capable of supporting multiple meshnets
- Supports both serial and network connections for Meshtastic devices
- Custom keys are embedded in Matrix messages which are used when relaying messages between two or more meshnets.
- Truncates long messages to fit within Meshtastic's payload size
- SQLite database to store Meshtastic longnames for improved functionality
- Customizable logging level for easy debugging
- Configurable through a simple YAML file
- **New:** Supports mapping multiple rooms and channels 1:1


## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay.git
```

### Setup

Create a Python virtual environment in the project directory:

```
python3 -m venv .pyenv
```

Activate the virtual environment and install dependencies:

```
source .pyenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` in the project directory with the appropriate values. A sample configuration is provided below:

```yaml
matrix:
  homeserver: "https://example.matrix.org"
  access_token: "reaalllllyloooooongsecretttttcodeeeeeeforrrrbot"
  bot_user_id: "@botuser:example.matrix.org"

matrix_rooms:  # Needs at least 1 room & channel, but supports all Meshtastic channels
  - id: "!someroomid:example.matrix.org"
    meshtastic_channel: 0
  - id: "!someroomid2:example.matrix.org"
    meshtastic_channel: 2

meshtastic:
  connection_type: serial  # Choose either "network" or "serial"
  serial_port: /dev/ttyUSB0  # Only used when connection is "serial"
  host: "meshtastic.local" # Only used when connection is "network"
  meshnet_name: "VeryCoolMeshnet" # This is displayed in full on Matrix, but is truncated when sent to a Meshnet
  broadcast_enabled: true

logging:
  level: "info"
  show_timestamps: true
  timestamp_format: '[%H:%M:%S]'
```

## Usage
Activate the virtual environment:
```
source .pyenv/bin/activate
```
Run the `main.py` script:
```
python main.py
```
Example output:
```

$ python main.py
