# M<>M Relay

## (Meshtastic <=> Matrix Relay)

A powerful and easy-to-use relay between Meshtastic devices and Matrix chat rooms, allowing seamless communication across platforms. This opens the door for bridging Meshtastic devices to [many other platforms](https://matrix.org/bridges/).

## Features

- Bidirectional message relay between Meshtastic devices and Matrix chat rooms, capable of supporting multiple meshnets
- Supports serial, network, and **_BLE (now too!)_** connections for Meshtastic devices
- Custom fields are embedded in Matrix messages for relaying messages between multiple meshnets
- Truncates long messages to fit within Meshtastic's payload size
- SQLite database to store node information for improved functionality
- Customizable logging level for easy debugging
- Configurable through a simple YAML file
- Supports mapping multiple rooms and channels 1:1
- Relays messages to/from an MQTT broker, if configured in the Meshtastic firmware
- ✨️ _Bidirectional replies and reactions support_ ✨️ **NEW!!**
- ✨️ _Native Docker support_ ✨️ **NEW!!**

_We would love to support [Matrix E2EE rooms](https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay/issues/33), but this is currently not implemented._

---

## Quick Start

MMRelay runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

```bash
# Install using pipx for isolated installation (recommended)
pipx install mmrelay

# Generate a sample configuration file & then edit it
mmrelay --generate-config

# Start the relay (without --install-service to run manually)
mmrelay --install-service
```

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, see the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Docker

MMRelay includes official Docker support for easy deployment and management:

```bash
# Quick setup with Docker
make setup   # Copy config and open editor (first time)
make build   # Build the Docker image
make run     # Start the container
make logs    # View logs
```

Docker provides isolated environment, easy deployment, automatic restarts, and volume persistence.

For detailed Docker setup instructions, see the [Docker Guide](docs/DOCKER.md).

> **Note**: Docker builds currently use a temporary fork of the meshtastic library with BLE hanging fixes. PyPI releases use the upstream library. This will be resolved when the fixes are merged upstream.

See the full list of [core plugins](https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay/wiki/Core-Plugins).

### Community & Custom Plugins

MMRelay's plugin system allows you to extend functionality in two ways:

- **Custom Plugins**: Create personal plugins for your own use, stored in `~/.mmrelay/plugins/custom/`
- **Community Plugins**: Share your creations with others or use plugins developed by the community

Check the [Community Plugins Development Guide](https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay/wiki/Community-Plugin-Development-Guide) in our wiki to get started.

✨️ Visit the [Community Plugins List](https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay/wiki/Community-Plugin-List)!

#### Install a Community Plugin

Add the repository under the `community-plugins` section in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
community-plugins:
  example-plugin:
    active: true
    repository: https://github.com/jeremiah-k/mmr-plugin-template.git
    tag: main
```

### Plugin System

Plugins make it easy to extend functionality without modifying the core program. MMRelay features a powerful plugin system with standardized locations:

- **Core Plugins**: Pre-installed with the package
- **Custom Plugins**: Your own plugins in `~/.mmrelay/plugins/custom/`
- **Community Plugins**: Third-party plugins in `~/.mmrelay/plugins/community/`
